Starting from the Spring and Autumn Warring States period, countries independently built sections of the wall in the north to avoid the invasion of the Huns. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China, he continued to build to link the pre-existing defenses. The building continued to be built until the Ming Dynasty. The Great Wall of China functioned as a military defense to protect China from invasions by northern nomadic tribes such as the Mongols and Manchus. Because of this important role, it was continuously extended for the next 2000 years, until the end of the Ming Dynasty, expanding to 15 provinces in China, taking the shape of the Dragon.</p>

After her husband's funeral, she jumped into the sea to commit suicide. This story becomes one of the four most famous folk legends in Chinese culture, next to Niu Lang Zhi Nu, Bach Xa Truyen and Luong Son Ba Chuc Anh Dai.</p>
